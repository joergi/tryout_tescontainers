# tryout_testcontainers

## tryout for yourself:
- AWS: creating S3 bucket, S3 IAM role, S3 user & add it to S3 role
- you have to change the accesskey + secretkey in AWSConfig.java to the one of the S3 user (soon: application.yml)
- the first test run, will take a little bit longer because of downloading the ~400MB container
